I was born and raised in Woodhaven, Queens, New York City. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡¾

I am currently a first year in Duke University's Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Doctoral Program. I have research experience in pathogen genomics.

I studied Computer Science during my undergraduate at Columbia Engineering. I was introduced the field of bioinformatics and studied transposon-encoded CRISPR-Cas systems (under Sam Sternberg). 

For my gap years, I worked at the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard's Genomic Center for Infectious Disease where I worked on projects in medical mycology (under Christina Cuomo) and vector-borne disease (under Daniel Neafsey). I worked with the Guyana Ministry of Health to develop their national pathogen surveillance program through building national genomics sequencing capacity.
 
My first rotation at Duke University is with Paul Magwene looking at mobile genetic elements in pathogenic fungi.
